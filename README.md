## genders

```An extensive list of genders to make dynamically generating gender options for your project easy. Because being inclusive is important.```


```Remember...

biological sex doesn't determine gender.

gender doesn't determine sexual preference.

biological sex doesn't determine sexual preference.

gender and sex are spectrums. Not a binary.

01100111 01100101 01101110 01100100 01100101 01110010  <--- this is the exception...
```

I imagine this package will be a continuous work in progress.

If there is a gender you would like to see on this list let me know.
